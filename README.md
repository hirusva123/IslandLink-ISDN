What we built
IslandLink ISDN is a comprehensive Centralised Island-wide Sales Distribution Management System designed to streamline wholesale sales, inventory management, and logistics operations. The system features a complete end-to-end workflow with three primary user interfaces:
1. Customer Portal: Allows retail customers to browse the product catalog, add items to their cart, and place orders with an integrated checkout system.
2. Admin Dashboard: Enables head office administrators to monitor daily sales metrics, manage product inventory (CRUD operations), and track the status of customer orders.
3. Driver/Logistics View: Provides delivery drivers with real-time job lists, order status updates, and dynamic route tracking utilizing Google Maps.

Technologies Used
* Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
* Backend: Python (Flask Web Framework)
* Database: MySQL
* APIs & Libraries: Google Maps API (for live driver tracking and routing), Flask-CORS
